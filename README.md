### _Accelerated Learning and Resource Allocation for Optical Networks_

See the documentation at https://micdoh.github.io/XLRON/

## Overview

XLRON ("ex-el-er-on") is an open-source project that provides a suite of gym-style environments for simulating resource allocation problems in optical networks using reinforcement learning techniques. It is built on the JAX machine learning framework, enabling accelerated training on GPU and TPU hardware.

XLRON is a product of my PhD research, which is focused on the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to a set of resource allocation and combinatorial optimisation problems in Optical Networks. The project is currently in the early stages of development.

### Key Features

- Gym-style environments for optical network resource allocation problems.
- Powered by JAX for accelerated training on GPU and TPU.
- Facilitates the development and discovery of optimised resource allocation policies.
- Implementations of heuristics (kSP-FF, etc.) for benchmarking and comparison.
- Ideal for research, experimentation, and innovation in optical network optimization.
