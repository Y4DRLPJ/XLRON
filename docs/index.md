## _Optical Networks experiments with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Accelerated Environments in JAX_

(Coming soon: an improved acronym for this project)

This project provides a set of tools explore the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to combinatorial optimisation problems in Optical Networks.  It is a product of my PhD research, which is focused on the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the same set of resource allocation problems. The project is currently in the early stages of development.

The gym-style environments follow the example set in [Gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax), a project by Robert Lange.

The PPO implementation in this project derives from the excellent [PureJaxRL](https://github.com/luchris429/purejaxrl) by Chris Lu.
