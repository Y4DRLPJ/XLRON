# Installation

## Requirements

XLRON is a research tool intended to be downloaded as a repository, not installed as a package. This offers greater flexibility to the user if they wish to modify or extend the codebase.

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. 
Requirements are defined in pyproject.toml and can be installed with poetry. See [quickstart](quickstart.md) for more details.
